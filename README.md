#### Talk on Django for Georgia Tech's Web Development club

This repository contains the presentation, script, and code I used for a recent talk introducing Django to [gt-webdev](http://www.gtwebdev.org/)'s members.

#### What's in this repository?

- The `/shortlink/` directory of this repo contains the code for this presentation. I implemented a very basic URL-shorting service in this directory while explaining the fundamentals of Django to the club. Using this code, I explained how to deploy this app onto [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and DNS configuration settings for a personal domain.

- [Here is the brief presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YyHUYyFhcJkNdgQEs8penGY5OSthqSZnBpPJWPCAvwU/edit?usp=sharing) I used for this talk.

- [Here is the technical script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lrRUcvNIw3GOFwh1DoNroDDsuygjNMm6oJomrIQEZbM/edit) I created to guide me during the live coding portion of the talk. This document is the best place to go to understand how the short URL service was developed during the talk.

The presentation and script can also be found in this repository in PDF form.
